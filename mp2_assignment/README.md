MP2 Assignment due 10/21/2025


## AI Use

I have previous experience building/deploying an app to the store using flutter. Throughout some parts of my project, I reference different things I have done and implemented them in here. Given I used AI on that project, there are certain concepts I have learned (like very specific text properties, widgets, etc).

However, there is one area I would like to recognize and credit that I have used to assitance to AI. I was able to build out my Inbox and enjoyed it, however trying to implement the split screen functionality was extremely difficult, and I will reference what section of my code was built using AI. Keep in mind that I didn't just do this all at once, but was just slowly prompting to help save myself time on refactoring (I knew the logic I needed, but refactoring would've taken me a lot more time and I had already allocated too much time to this project).

### Lines 94 through 150

These lines were used with the assitance of chatGPT 5 Thinking. Essentially I had already wrote the code I needed but used chat to refactor and then apply the code I had made into the conditional statements as needed. While some edits were needed to my code I had wrote it was not that much. But this section was thoughtfully built out with Chat GPT assistance.
